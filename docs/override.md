# Reversible overrides

Import `github.com/JSYoo5B/ceph-testcontainers-go/override` alongside `ceph`.
The package changes cluster-wide state of a cluster created by `ceph.Run` for a
while and puts it back. Each operation is a function that takes the cluster and
returns a handle; the handle owns the change and its `Restore` undoes only what
the call did. This page documents the first kind, the client blocklist entry.
The other override kinds are still methods of `ceph.Container` and move here in
separate changes (see the [design](design/override-package-boundary.md)).

0.x: old names are removed without aliases. `Container.TemporaryBlocklist` and
`ceph.BlocklistOverride` no longer exist in `ceph`:

| Previous call or type | New call or type |
| --- | --- |
| `cluster.TemporaryBlocklist(ctx, address, duration)` | `override.AddBlocklist(ctx, cluster, address, duration)` |
| `*ceph.BlocklistOverride` | `*override.BlocklistHandle` (same `Address` and `Restore`) |

`ceph.BlocklistEntry` and `Observer.BlocklistEntries` stay in `ceph`: they only
read the OSDMap. The package imports `ceph`; `ceph` never imports it. See the
[migration guide](guides/upgrading-override-package.md).

## Handle contract

- The function returns a non-nil handle for every outcome, so the handle can be
  deferred or registered for cleanup before the error is looked at.
- A call that is refused or never applied returns a handle that owns nothing.
  Its `Restore` returns nil, takes no lock, never reports a restoration and
  leaves the cluster and the registry alone. The reason is the returned error.
- A call whose outcome is uncertain (the command may have been applied, for
  example after a lost reply or a canceled context) returns a real handle
  together with the error. Its `Restore` still removes the entry it may have
  created.
- A copy of a handle shares its state, and `Restore` is retryable with a fresh
  context after an uncertain failure.
- The zero value of a handle, and a nil handle, are unavailable: `Restore`
  returns an error.
- `Terminate` does not undo an override. The change ends with the cluster, and a
  `Restore` after `Terminate` is refused with the error of an operation on a
  terminated cluster.

Every function admits the cluster as a method of `ceph.Container` does. A
cluster that a `SharedCluster` lends to tenants refuses the call with
`ceph.ErrSharedCluster` and `OperationError.Op` set to the function name, such as
`override.AddBlocklist`; a cluster lent to one exclusive lease accepts it.
`Tenant` has no forwarder. A nil cluster returns a not-applied handle and an
error classified `ceph.ErrInvalidRequest`.

## AddBlocklist

```golang
func AddBlocklist(ctx context.Context, c *ceph.Container, address string, duration time.Duration) (*override.BlocklistHandle, error)
```

Fences one specific client session for `duration` (at least one second). The
address must be the session's exact `IP:port/nonce` with a nonzero nonce, so
other clients on the same host are unaffected. Get it from the client after it
connects (librados `rados_getaddrs`, go-ceph `Conn.GetAddrs`), from
[ObjectWatchers](ceph.md#objectwatchers), from an RBD lock owner or from a CephFS
session. A v1/v2 address vector is accepted only when all entries denote the same
IP, port and nonce; protocol types become native `ANY` entries. Bare IPs, CIDR
ranges, nonce zero and existing entries are refused, and an existing entry is
never renewed or adopted.

The verb is `Add` because the call creates one entry that did not exist, and
`Restore` removes only that entry.

| Outcome | Handle | Error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry added and read back | Real | nil |
| Nil cluster | Not applied | `ErrInvalidRequest`, `Op` `override.AddBlocklist` |
| Shared cluster | Not applied | `ErrSharedCluster`, `Op` `override.AddBlocklist` |
| Invalid address | Not applied | `ErrInvalidRequest` |
| Duration below one second | Not applied | plain error |
| Terminated cluster or no control container | Not applied | the cluster's own error |
| This session is already held by another handle | Not applied | plain error |
| The native blocklist cannot be read before the add | Not applied, reservation released | the native error |
| The session already has a native entry | Not applied, reservation released | `ErrInvalidRequest` |
| The add or the readback after it fails | Real, uncertain | the joined errors |
| The add succeeds but no entry is stored | Real, uncertain | plain error |

## BlocklistHandle

| Method | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Address() string` | The exact session that the handle fences, as canonicalized (`IP:port/nonce`). A call refused before the address was accepted returns the address as passed. |
| `Restore(ctx) error` | Removes only this entry. |

`Restore` checks the expiration captured at the add before it removes anything:
an entry renewed by someone else is refused with `ErrInvalidRequest`, and an
entry that is gone (natural expiry) counts as removed. An unknown readback at the
add cannot authorize the removal of a present entry; inspect the native state or
terminate the disposable cluster. A lost removal reply is retried: after
confirmed absence, copies are no-ops. After removal OSDs admit the address again,
but how the session recovers depends on the client library; with librados both
the existing session and a new connection recover. External blocklist edits must
not race the helper.

```golang
// address is the client's own session address, e.g. from rados_getaddrs or
// go-ceph Conn.GetAddrs: "172.19.0.6:0/3461995546".
fence, err := override.AddBlocklist(ctx, cluster, address, time.Minute)
// fence is never nil: after a refusal its Restore does nothing.
defer fence.Restore(context.Background())
if err != nil {
	t.Fatal(err)
}
// The fenced session's operations fail (ESHUTDOWN in librados); another session
// from the same host keeps working.
if err := fence.Restore(ctx); err != nil {
	t.Fatal(err)
}
```

`ceph.Observer.BlocklistEntries` shows the entry and its expiry. For RBD
exclusive-lock handover, the lock owner's address comes from `rbd.ImageClients`
(see [rbd](rbd.md)).
