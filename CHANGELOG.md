# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org); before v1.0.0 a minor release may
change the API.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `ceph.Container.DaemonAddresses` reads the names and advertised address
  vectors of every MON, the active and standby MGRs and every OSD from the
  native maps, with each map's epoch.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-11)

The first release. It provides four Testcontainers for Go modules that start
a real, disposable Ceph cluster for integration tests.

### Packages

- `ceph`: the cluster. `Run` starts the MON, MGR and OSD topology from the
  official Ceph image, by default one MON, one MGR and two OSDs with file-backed
  BlueStore. The `Container` adds and removes MONs, MGRs and OSDs, creates and
  places pools, manages Cephx identities and configuration overrides, waits for
  health, quorum and clean PGs, injects faults (stopping, pausing and
  disconnecting daemons and clients, delaying or dropping messages, fencing,
  full clusters and damaged replicas) and collects diagnostics.
- `rbd`: initialized RBD pools and namespaces, image watchers and locks, pool
  and image mirroring between two clusters, and full or incremental backup and
  restore.
- `cephfs`: filesystems and their MDS topology, subvolume groups, subvolumes,
  snapshots and clones, pins, quiesce sets, client authorization and sessions,
  and snapshot mirroring between two clusters.
- `rgw`: S3 and Swift gateways, users, tenants, accounts and quotas, placement
  targets and storage classes, native TLS, usage, and multisite zones and sync
  policies across clusters.

Each package has a `Run` that starts a cluster with the service's defaults and
a `Container` that embeds `testcontainers.Container`; options of several
service packages can be passed to one `ceph.Run`.

### Requirements

- Go 1.25 or later and Testcontainers for Go v0.44.0.
- A Docker engine that runs Linux containers; no privileged mode or host
  devices are needed. Host networking has extra requirements, described in
  [the host network guide](docs/guides/host-network.md).
- Ceph Tentacle 20.2.x (`ceph.DefaultImage`, `quay.io/ceph/ceph:v20.2.4`
  pinned by digest) or Squid 19.2.x with the differences in
  [the releases guide](docs/guides/releases-and-images.md).

The modules control Ceph through the CLIs inside the containers and build with
`CGO_ENABLED=0`; they have no go-ceph, librados or cgo dependency.
